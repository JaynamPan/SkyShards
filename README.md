### Introduction
This is a webpage for game 'Sky-Children of The Light'. It shows the predictions of the shards eruption times and locations.    

Visit [Ava's Sky Shards Page](https://jaynampan.github.io/SkyShards/) for demo.   

### Notes
I used /docs folder to store the demo Github Page.

### Credits
